# Doubly-linked-list

This project is a C++ implementation of a generic doubly linked list that supports dynamic data types. 
It allows bidirectional navigation through nodes using next and prev pointers. 
The list provides functionality for adding and removing nodes at specific positions, as well as at the beginning or end. 
A user pointer (upoint) is included to facilitate controlled traversal and data access.
Additionally, utility functions like retrieving data, determining the size of the list, and debugging the structure with a dump() method are implemented. 
This code is a great example of advanced pointer-based programming and data structure management in C++.

Here are the following commands.

    "add"  adds a node with data d at index i in the list.
    "addf" adds a node with data d  at the beginning of the list.
    "addl" adds a node with data d at the end of the list.
    "rem"  removes the node at index i from the list.
    "remf" removes the first node from the list.
    "reml" removes the last node from the list.
    "get"  retirieves and displays the data at index i.
    "getf" retrieves and displays the data in the first node.
    "getl" retrieves and diplays the data in the last node.
    "reset" resets the user pointer (upoint) to point to the head of the list.
    "adv"  advances the user pointer (upoint) to the next node.
    "rew"  rewinds the user pointer (upoint) to the previous node.
    "getup" retrieves and displays the data at the node currently pointed to by upoint.
    "dump" displays the entire list, including its size, first node, and last node.
    "quit" exits program.
